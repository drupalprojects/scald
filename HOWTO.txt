This is a quick'n'dirty guide, intended for developers, explaining
how to setup a Scald enabled instance.

I] Activate a bunch of modules that'll make the whole thing usable:
 o  DnD
 o  MEE
 o  Scald
 o  Scald DnD Library
 o  Scald Dailymotion (will provide quickly a bunch of video atoms for
    testing purpose)

II] Permissions:
  1 - Give every role that as the "access content" permission the
      "use scald" permissions
  2 - Go to Administer -> Content -> Scald -> Actions, and gives
      every listed role the Fetch and View actions
  3 - Go to Administer -> Content -> Scald -> Types, and for each
      of Audio, Video and Image, change the default actions
      bitstring to 5.

III] Atoms generation
  1 - Use the DailyMotion video search interface to search for a
      video an import it as your first atom
  2 - Add one or more automatic import at Administer > Site configuration
     -> DailyMotion imports
     (Suggestion: Type: Tag / Identifier: Drupal)
  3 - Go to cron.php to launch batch processing
  4 - If you have Views installed, a bunch of atoms should now appears
      at Administer -> Content -> Scald -> Atoms

IV] Input format configuration
  1 - Go to Administer -> Site configuration -> Input format
  2 - Choose the configure link next to the input format you'll be using
      for your multimedia enabled contents
  3 - Check the box in front of Scald Atom Shorthand Filter, click Save
      configuration.
  4 - Click the configure link again
  5 - Go to the Rearrange tab, and check that the Scald Atom Shorthand
      Filter is the last filter in the list.

(Those instruction assume that you will be using Scald / MEE in a mode
where users can't edit the ressource options when its dragged into the
RTE, which is the safe choice.
*If* you're in a situation where you're sure that only trusted users will
have access to this input format, and you want them to be able to
change the ressource HTML output on a case by case basis, then you
should instead the the "mee_store_sas" variable to FALSE, and edit the
input filter to allow all the html tags that your atoms providers will
output. In this case, Scald won't alter the output unless the user
viewing the content don't have access to the including atom)

V] Configure a Scald-enabled CCK Field
(Given as an example)
  1 - Edit a content type, go to Manage fields screen
  2 - Add a new field, of type Multimedia Editorial Element (MEE),
      choosing the only available formatter.
  3 - In the field settings, use the following settings
      Rows: 60
      Number of values: 1 (don't work with multiple fiedls for now,
      patches welcome :-))
      Text processing: Filtered text
      Library Callback URL: scald/library_dnd
      Scald Editor Context: Editor representation

V] Go to the node form, enjoy
