This is a quick'n'dirty guide, intended for developers, explaining
how to setup a Scald enabled instance.

I] Activate a bunch of modules that'll make the whole thing usable:
 o  Views
 o  DnD
 o  MEE
 o  Scald
 o  Scald DnD Library
 o  Scald Dailymotion (will provide quickly a bunch of video atoms for
    testing purpose)

II] Permissions:
  1 - Give every role that has the "access content" permission the
      "use scald" permissions
  2 - Go to Administer -> Content -> Scald -> Actions, and gives
      every listed role the Fetch and View actions
  3 - Go to Administer -> Content -> Scald -> Types, and for each
      of Audio, Video and Image, change the default actions
      bitstring to 5.

III] Atoms generation
  1 - Use the DailyMotion video search interface to search for a
      video an import it as your first atom
  2 - Add one or more automatic import at Administer > Site configuration
     -> DailyMotion imports
     (Suggestion: Type: Tag / Identifier: Drupal)
  3 - Go to cron.php to launch batch processing
  4 - If you have Views installed, a bunch of atoms should now appears
      at Administer -> Content management -> Scald -> Atoms

IV] Configure a Scald-enabled CCK Field
(Given as an example)
  1 - Edit a content type, go to Manage fields screen
  2 - Add a new field, of type Multimedia Editorial Element (MEE),
      choosing the only available formatter.
  3 - In the field settings, use the default settings except for the
      Scald Editor Context, that should be set to 'Editor representation'

V] Go to the node form, enjoy

Those instructions assume that you will be using Scald / MEE in a mode
where users can't edit the ressource options when its dragged into the
RTE, which is the safe choice.
*If* you're in a situation where you're sure that only trusted users will
have access to the input format, and you want them to be able to
change the ressource HTML output on a case by case basis, then you
should instead set the "mee_store_sas" variable to FALSE, and edit the
input filter to allow all the html tags that your atoms providers will
output. In this case, Scald won't alter the output unless the user
viewing the content doesn't have access to the included atom

By default, Scald assumes that all users should be registered as authors.
This can be turned off in settings.php, using

<code>
  $conf['scald_register_users_as_authors'] = FALSE;
</code>

This option should be set before Scald is first enabled. Switching this
option on or off after the module is first enabled can have unintended
consquences.
